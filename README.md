LibreNews is a client for the LibreNews server. It is a free, fast, open-source, and decentralized breaking news notification app. Whenever anything noteworthy happens in the world, you can be sure that you'll be notified.

Breaking news notifications are perhaps the most important channel by which we receive our information about the world, and LibreNews aims to democratize this essential medium. Don't let any corporation or government agency control your breaking news.
